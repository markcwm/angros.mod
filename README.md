## Introduction
OpenB3D is a lightweight OpenGL 1.4+ 3D engine written in C++, this is the BlitzMax wrapper for it. OpenB3D is based on [MiniB3D](https://github.com/si-design/minib3d) which was based on [Blitz3D](https://github.com/blitz-research/blitz3d). Since the standard commands are the same, the Blitz3d manual can be used as a reference. Help can be found at the SyntaxBomb [MiniB3D Board](http://www.syntaxbomb.com/index.php/board,20.0.html) or the BlitzCoder [OpenB3D Board](https://www.blitzcoder.org/forum/topics.php?category=16).

## Features
* Works with [Legacy/BRL BlitzMax](https://github.com/blitz-research/blitzmax) and [BlitzMax NG](https://github.com/bmx-ng/bmx-ng/releases) in 32-bit and 64-bit on Windows, Mac or Linux
* The wrapper is object-oriented with a procedural interface like in MiniB3D
* Since entities are objects (and not integer handles like in Blitz3D) you must specify their type at creation
* Object types are the same as in MiniB3D, but Type fields are pointers except for lists, also some field names were changed
* The coordinate system is not OpenGL orientation, it is left-handed like in Blitz3D
* Works with BRL.MaxGui like MiniB3D, which allows more control of application windows
* BRL.Max2d is used for 2D-in-3D rendering which along with BRL.Graphics is like 2D commands in Blitz3D
* The STB Image library is used to load texture formats, it supports TGA, BMP, GIF and PSD
* BRL image loaders are used for PNG and JPG as they are more stable
* DDS texture files support compressed textures in video memory - needs a tweak to Max2D (see docs/mod folder)
* File streams are supported for textures and meshes, allowing Incbin and [Koriolis.Zipstream](https://github.com/maxmods/koriolis.mod)
* Native 3D model formats are 3DS, OBJ (no animation), B3D (skeletal animation) and MD2 (vertex interpolation)
* Several more 3D formats can be loaded with the Assimp library wrapper - no animation
* Collision detection consists of Blitz3d's ellipsoid-to-something collisions, dynamic collisions are possible
* Realtime textures are created with BackBufferToTex (for cubemaps) or CameraToTex, also DepthBufferToTex
* Shader post-processing uses CameraToTex to render to screen sprites or PostFX framebuffer rendering
* Quaternions are used for rotations instead of Eulers in MiniB3D, this avoids Gimbal lock
* Terrains are similar to Blitz3D but UpdateNormals replaces TerrainShading, TerrainDetail takes a smaller value
* Vertex and Fragment shaders with examples written to comply with GLSL 1.10 (GL 2.0)
* Shader effects include bump map, toon, blur, anti alias, colorgrading, depth of field, bloom
* Dynamic lighting and linear fog with fixed function or programmable graphics (shaders)
* Realtime volumetric stencil shadows with self-shadowing from multiple lights - no soft shadows
* Stencil commands for rendering mirror or portal effects
* CSG (constructive solid geometry) creates a mesh from existing ones (combine, subtract, intersect)
* Actions use an event-based entity control system, triggered once and then automatically updated
* Basic physics system consisting of constraints and rigid bodies
* Newton library wrapper but only supports primitives
* Sprites are now all from a single surface
* Particle emitter system with callback function for custom controls, uses sprites
* Particle Candy port, an advanced single surface particle system
* Software anti-alias like in MiniB3D, also multisample hardware anti-alias - only Windows

## Status

The wrapper is still in development, there are still bugs and missing features. I maintain it in my spare time, issues and pull requests are welcome. The library has a working GLES2 (WebGL) version, the wrapper still doesn't support it but maybe later! It should work with BRL or NG BlitzMax (on testing with v1.29 release). Note: I had issues with C++11 GCC 7.x or Clang/LLVM 5.x versions, not sure but if you have these try using a more recent compiler.

## Installation
* Click on the Github Download zip link and extract to your `BlitzMax/mod` folder
* Remove **-master** from the **openb3d.mod-master** folder - modules must end in **.mod**
* On Windows, you need a working version of the MinGW compiler
* On Mac, you need a compatible version of XCode installed
* On Linux, read my guide: [How To: Install BlitzMax NG on Win/Mac/Ubuntu 64-bit](https://www.syntaxbomb.com/index.php/topic,61.0.html)
* To build for BRL Blitzmax, open Cmd, cd to `BlitzMax/bin` and type `bmk makemods -d openb3d`
* For Blitzmax NG in 64-bit use `bmk makemods -d -w -g x64 openb3d` - on Unix use `./bmk`
* Or from MaxIDE enable Quick Build, Debug, GUI App then Build Modules
* To syntax highlight commands use `./makedocs` or the MaxIDE option Rebuild Documentation
