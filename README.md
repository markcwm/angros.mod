## Introduction

OpenB3DMax is an OpenGL 1.4+ 3D engine for BlitzMax which is based on [Minib3d](https://github.com/si-design/minib3d) which was based on [Blitz3D](https://github.com/blitz-research/blitz3d). Since the standard commands are the same, the Blitz3d manual can be used as a partial reference. Help can be found at the SyntaxBomb [Minib3d Board](http://www.syntaxbomb.com/index.php/board,20.0.html) or the BlitzCoder [Openb3dmax Board](https://www.blitzcoder.org/forum/topics.php?category=16).

## Features

* Works with [BRL BlitzMax](https://github.com/blitz-research/blitzmax) and [BlitzMax NG](https://github.com/bmx-ng/bmx-ng/releases) in 32-bit or 64-bit on Windows, Mac or Linux (no mobile platforms)
* The wrapper is object-oriented combined with a procedural interface like in Minib3d
* Since entities are objects (and not integer handles like in Blitz3D) you must specify their type at creation
* Object types are the same as Minib3d, but Type fields are pointers except lists, also field names may have been changed
* The coordinate system is not OpenGL orientation, it is left-handed like in Minib3d
* Works with BRL.MaxGui like Minib3d, which allows more control of application windows
* BRL.Max2d is used for 2D-in-3D rendering which along with BRL.Graphics is similar to Blitz3d's 2D commands
* The STB Image library is used to load texture formats, it supports TGA, BMP, GIF and PSD (also PNG and JPG)
* BRL image loaders are used for PNG and JPG as they are more stable
* DDS files support compressed textures in video memory, but this requires a tweak to Max2D (see docs/mod folder)
* File streams are supported for images and meshes, this allows Incbin and [Koriolis.Zipstream](https://github.com/maxmods/koriolis.mod)
* Native 3D model formats are 3DS and OBJ (no animation), B3D (skeletal animation) and MD2 (vertex interpolation)
* Several more 3D formats can be loaded with the Assimp library wrapper (but no animation)
* Collision detection consists of Blitz3d's ellipsoid-to-something collisions, dynamic collisions are also possible
* Realtime textures are created with BackBufferToTex (for cubemaps) or CameraToTex and also DepthBufferToTex
* Shader post-processing uses CameraToTex to render to screen sprites or PostFX framebuffer render functions
* Quaternions are used for rotations instead of Eulers as in Minib3d, this avoids the Gimbal lock bug
* Terrains are similar to Blitz3D but UpdateNormals replaces TerrainShading, TerrainDetail takes a smaller value
* Vertex and Fragment shaders are supported with examples written to comply with GLSL 1.10 (GL 2.0) syntax
* Shader effects available include bump map, toon, blur, anti alias, colorgrading, depth of field, god rays, bloom
* Dynamic lighting and linear fog with fixed function or programmable graphics pipelines (shaders)
* Realtime volumetric stencil shadows with self-shadowing from multiple lights (no soft shadows)
* Stencil commands for rendering mirror or portal effects
* CSG (constructive solid geometry) creates a new mesh from existing ones (combine, subtract, intersect)
* Actions use an event-based entity control system, where it is triggered once and then automatically updated
* Basic physics system consisting of constraints and rigid bodies
* Particle emitter system with callback function to allow complete control
* Alternative particle system using fast single-surface batch sprites ported from Minib3d Monkey
* Software anti-alias like in Minib3d, also multisample hardware anti-alias (but only in Windows)
* 3D sound module using Brl.Audio, similar to Blitz3D but sounds can also be qued, stopped, paused and resumed per entity

## Status

This wrapper is in beta stage of development, so there are still a few bugs and missing features. It is not being maintained as regularly now but fixes are still made or accepted. The library has a working GLES2 (WebGL) version but the wrapper still doesn't support this, maybe later! The latest version should work with BRL or NG BlitzMax (on testing with v0.99 release) but there may still be an issue with C++11 compilers like GCC 7.x (or Clang/LLVM 5.x) so if you can't build the modules you might try using an older compiler.

## Installation
* Click on the Github Download zip link, then extract contents to your `BlitzMax/mod` folder
* Remove **-master** from the main **openb3dmax.mod-master** folder (module names must end in **.mod**)
* Also, check the contents of **openb3dmax.mod** contains several different folders with **b3d** in the name
* If on Windows, make sure you have a working version of the MinGW compiler
* If on Mac, make sure you have an appropriate version of XCode installed
* If on Linux, read this guide: [How To: Install BlitzMax NG on Win/Mac/Ubuntu 64-bit](https://www.syntaxbomb.com/index.php/topic,61.0.html)
* To build the mod for BRL Blitzmax, open Command/Terminal, cd to `BlitzMax/bin` and type `bmk makemods -d openb3dmax`
* For Blitzmax NG in 64-bit you use `bmk makemods -d -w -g x64 openb3dmax` (on Mac/Linux you need `./bmk`)
* Or from MaxIDE make sure Quick Build, Debug, GUI App are on, then click Programs > Build Modules
